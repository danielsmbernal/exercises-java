## :oncoming_automobile: **Goals**:  

:white_check_mark: Create a program that reads data from N contributors (provided by the user), which can be a **natural person** or **legal person** , and then display the amount of taxes  paid by each one, as well as the total value of taxes collected. 

The natural person data are:  
:small_blue_diamond: name;  
:small_blue_diamond:annual income;  
:small_blue_diamond: health spending;  

The legal person data are:  
:small_blue_diamond: name;    
:small_blue_diamond: annual income;  
:small_blue_diamond: number of employees;

The rules to calculate the taxes are:

:small_orange_diamond: **Natural person**: If the annual income is below U$ 20000.0, 15% of the value is charged. If the annual income is U$ 20000.00 or above, 25% of the value is charged. If there was health expenses, 50% of these expenses are deducted from the tax.  

:small_orange_diamond:**Legal person**: Pay 16% tax. However, if the company has more then 10 employees, it pays 14% tax.
